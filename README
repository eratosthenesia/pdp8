What this is (current version):

This is just a PDP8 emulator. I haven't been able to
test it extensively, but it seems to be working
fine. It cannot emulate, at the moment, interrupts
or extended memory past 4 kilowords, but it'll have
the capabiility soon.

The goal is to create an easy-to-use and
time-accurate version of the PDP-8 that runs in
C, and a graphical interface for it (and to write
some example programs in PDP8).

I'm writing this so that people learning computer
science will have an easy-to-understand-but-really-
hard-to-program-well computer to practice on,
especially since there are a lot of nuances.
